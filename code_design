Problem statement: changing verification config files from synopsis to mentor requires manual file edits
Proposal: automated switcher app

As a person doing verifications, I want to be able to auto switch config files from synopsis to mentor

code design:
-from the command line, launch app with flag for a vendor
-old config files deleted from current working directory
-new config files written to current directory with correct pptypes
-machine files from prod should be synced to vrfy, for example:
--cp /apps/machineA.prod  -> /apps/machineA.vrfy


required classes:
-input getter
-file writer
-file copier
-file deleter
